# Airplane Crash Analysis
This is a Shiny dashboard project for analyzing airplane incidents data.

### The analysis consists of three tabs:

* Time tab: displays the number of airplane incidents by year, month, or day, depending on the user's selection. The data is visualized as a bar chart using the ggplot2 and plotly packages.
* Phase tab: displays the most common flight phases associated with airplane incidents, along with their visibility conditions. The data is visualized as a stacked bar chart using the ggplot2 and plotly packages.
* States tab: displays the number of airplane incidents by US state and Canadian province. The data is presented as a table using the DT package.
